You will be given a sentence from a chest X-ray report. If the sentence mentions that a positive finding is unchanged (it is still positive) or improved (but still positive), rewrite it to only report the positive finding. Otherwise, keep it the same. If a sentence is empty or contains "REMOVED", do not change it.
