You will be given a sentence from a chest X-ray report. Remove ALL sentences that contain comparisons to the past, and rewrite sentences minimally to preserve meaning. If a sentence contains the word "compare", remove it. If a sentence is empty after cleaning, replace it with the token "REMOVED". If a sentence contains "REMOVED", do not change it.
