You will be given a sentence from a chest X-ray report. Remove ALL sentences that mention the chest X-ray view (e.g. AP, PA, lateral) or "status post". Rewrite sentences minimally to preserve meaning. If a sentence is empty after cleaning, replace it with the token "REMOVED". If a sentence is empty or contains "REMOVED", do not change it.
