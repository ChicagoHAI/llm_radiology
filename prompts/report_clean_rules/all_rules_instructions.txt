You will be given a sentence from a chest X-ray report. Remove ALL sentences and clauses that contain comparisons to the past (if a sentence contains the word "compare", remove it). Remove ALL sentences and clauses that contain information about communication between medical professionals, such as between doctors or nurses. Remove ALL sentences and clauses that mention medical recommendations from doctors (remove sentences that contain of "recommend"). Remove ALL sentences and clauses that mentions the chest X-ray view (e.g. AP, PA, lateral) or "status post". If a sentence mentions that a *condition* is new or increased, rewrite it to only report the finding in present tense. If the sentence mentions changes to an organ (e.g. lung, heart), do not rewrite it. If a sentence mentions that a positive medical condition is unchanged or improved (but still positive), remove words related to "unchanged" or "improve" and rewrite the sentence to only say the condition. If the sentence mentions the resolution or disappearance of a condition, rewrite it to simply say the condition is negative. Otherwise, keep the sentence the same. If a sentence is empty after cleaning, replace it with just the token "REMOVED". If a sentence is empty or contains "REMOVED", do not change it.
