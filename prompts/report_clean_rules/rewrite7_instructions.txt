You will be given a sentence from a chest X-ray report. If the sentence mentions the resolution or disappearance of a condition (from positive to negative), rewrite the sentence minimally to report the condition as negative. Keywords include resolve, disappear, clear. Otherwise, DO NOT rewrite the sentence. If a sentence is empty or contains the token "REMOVED", DO NOT change it.
