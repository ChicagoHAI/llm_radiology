You will be given a sentence from a chest X-ray report. If a part of a sentence mentions the resolution or disappearance of a medical condition, only rewrite that part to simply say "no <insert condition here>". Do NOT change other parts of the sentence. If a sentence is empty or contains "REMOVED", do not change it.
