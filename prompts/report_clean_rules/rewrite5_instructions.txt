You will be given a sentence from a chest X-ray report. If a sentence mentions that a *condition* is new or increased, rewrite it to only report the finding in present tense. If the sentence mentions changes to an organ (e.g. lung, heart), do not rewrite it. Otherwise, keep it the same. If a sentence is empty or contains "REMOVED", do not change it.
